\section{SMTP protocol}

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a technical standard for transmitting electronic mail over a network.
The main function of SMTP is to transfer data from the sender to the recipient.
When a sender sends an email, SMTP opens a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection, as it uses TCP as its transport protocol.
The email client begins the email sending process with a specialized ``Hello'' command.
The client then sends a series of commands containing the actual content of the email, such as the email header and email body.
The server runs a program called MTA (Mail Transfer Agent), which checks the domain of the recipient's email address. After transferring the data, the connection is closed.

\section{SMTP Server}

An SMTP server is a mail server that can send and receive emails using the SMTP protocol.
Various software programs run on an SMTP server. The Mail Submission Agent (MSA) receives emails from the email client.
The Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) transfers email to the next server in the delivery chain.
The Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) receives emails from MTAs and stores them in the recipient's mailbox.
